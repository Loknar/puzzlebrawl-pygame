The goal was to recreate this puzzle game style in a game playable on windows/mac/linux.

Update, feb 2014:
I've rewritten the puzzlebrawl project in javascript, if you want to take a look at the outcome you can [watch a video of it here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTqvR5100E) or even [try it out for yourself here](https://notendur.hi.is/~sfg6/puzzlebrawl/v0.03b/).
