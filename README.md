===========

Swap and Match tile-based puzzle gameplay style.

Made with python & pygame.

The goal is to recreate the puzzle battle game style into a game playable on windows/mac/linux.

I'm aiming to have singleplayer modes ready at the end of the summer 2013 but I also aim at making some kind of multiplayer mode allowing players on separate computers to battle each other.
