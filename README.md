puzzlebrawl
===========

Swap and Match tile-based puzzle gameplay style.

Made with python & pygame.

By Sveinn Floki Gudmundsson (Loknar) - svefgud@gmail.com

The goal is to recreate this puzzle game style in a game playable on windows/mac/linux.

~~I'm aiming to have singleplayer modes ready at the end of 2013 but I also aim at making some kind of multiplayer mode allowing players on separate computers to compete against each other.~~

Update, feb 2014:
I've rewritten the puzzlebrawl project in javascript, if you want to take a look at the outcome you can [watch a video of it here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxTqvR5100E) or even [try it out for yourself here](https://notendur.hi.is/~sfg6/puzzlebrawl/v0.03b/).
